			<h1>My Passion, My glory, and My Drive!</h1>

			<p> Futbol : Soccer, what ever you call it , how ever you see it or wherever you watch it; it's a Passion that most people live with and enjoy expressing.
			As a young 20 something year old man Futbol was not much a huge part of my life until my early 30's. Thats when at 26 my life changed and not a few years later my passion for soccer started.</p><br>

			<p>As a dad raising an active young child, our only options to release and channel that rage, passion, and energy was to enroll my son into FUTBOL. At age 4/5 most kids don't do alot, back then, but annoy their parents and create chaos at home. Well as a soccer player myslef we decided to enroll him a local youth program called AYSO and that where it all began. Over the years my appreciation for soccer grew, especially with the development of my son and the other kids in his age bracket. After a fewyears of Recreational soccer, we decided to move him up to a more competitive program; where he excelled. As for myself, my knowledge and education grew various Certifications and programs I got involved with. After a few years I had to let my som go and let someon else help him grow as a person and player.</p><br>

			<p>Thru my time with Ayso, I saw a need and a void that the Latino community had with the program. AT that point I decided to further my volunteerism and help the programgrow. After a few season i became the commsioner of a program with over 150 kids ( ages 5 to 18 yeard old ) 30-40 volunteers; coaches, parents, referees, and a board consisting of 7 members.</p>
