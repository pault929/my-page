				So you may be asking why<i><strong>A Developer</strong> </i>? Well, that's the same question I ask myself every day! Really, there's only one answer? Freedom! Freedom how? Well Freedom to be able to be creative in a world growing with new ideas, technology, platforms, and inovation. I want to be able to choose my path, my time, my project, and control my life more; rathern than be stuck in "The Concrete Jungle" of the hustle and bussle.

			<p> One thing about me is that I like to build things, I like to make things easier, streamline work, streamline an experience, streamline productivity. By nature I am a builder ; mentaly and physixally. My background in the Hospitality Industry has taken me to many places and my experiences have helped me see many systems, ideas, functions and failures. I feel with the physical and mental <strong>ATTRIBUTE</strong> I can help create and build better programs, websites or products.
